I'll be chasing with a shame
I'll be caring until it fades
Until it fades
In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades
And we could escape the earth

In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades
Until it fades
In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades

I'll be chasing with a shame
I'll be caring until it fades
Until it fades
In this blue haze with a shame
In this blue haze until it fades
And we could escape the earth
