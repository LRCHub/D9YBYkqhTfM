Run away
Run away from here
Run away
Run away from here
Run away all alone
Run away from fear
Run away from sadness
Run away from tears
Run away from home
From the wife and kids
From the cats and the doggies
Run away to forgive
Run into the light
Run away from here
Hide away in the lion's den
Play with matches and get burned
Flyin' high in an aeroplane
Run away, run away, run away
In a fast car on a highway
Burnin' tracks towards sunset
No turning back and no regrets
I'll think of you if I don't forget
Run away
Run away, run away
Run away from here
Run away from the church
Run away from guilt
Run away from your dream
Everything you built
Run into the light
Run into the light
Run away from here
Hide away in the lion's den
Play with matches and get burned
Flyin' high in an aeroplane
Run away, run away, run away
In a fast car on a highway
Burnin' tracks towards sunset
No turning back and no regrets
I'll think of you
Run away from the office
From your old work shoes
Run away from crime
And the big city blues
Run away from money
And the jaws of death
Run away from lawyers
And the government
Run away from your friends
And your family too
Run away from yourself
Run away from you
Run away from here
Run away, run away
Run away from here
Run away from here
